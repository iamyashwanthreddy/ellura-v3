# Content sources, open items and credits (v3 redesign)

This is the v3 (Ritual-inspired) build. All copy, product data, prices, FAQs, articles, policies and references are carried over unchanged from v1/v2 — nothing new was invented for the redesign. Only the visual design, layout, typography and motion are new. The v3 homepage adds one small section (an “at a glance” rail) built only from facts already on the carton and the official site.

## Design references used for v3

| Source | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| https://ritual.com/ (inspected 1 Oct 2026) | Visual language only: warm minimal canvas, sticky header with a mega-panel, large editorial headlines, product tiles on soft tints, trust-indicator rail, hairline-ruled accordions and lists, calm image-led storytelling. No Ritual assets, copy or imagery were used. |
| Supplied logo (`ellura-logo-purple.webp`) | Plum `#5A2E58` sampled from the logo is the brand anchor. Lilac `#D0A6D8` and the cream `#FBF7F3` backdrop come from the official carton photography. Deep plum `#2B1429` and the sand/lilac tints are shades of those. |
| Fonts (OFL, self-hosted via @fontsource) | Newsreader (display, roman + italic) and Hanken Grotesk (body/UI). |
| https://ellurautihealth.com/ (re-checked 1 Oct 2026) | Hero headline/copy, 36 mg soluble A-type PACs per capsule, 100% concentrated cranberry fruit juice extract (*Vaccinium macrocarpon*), the three “how it works” steps — unchanged since the 30 Sep check below. |
| Supplied homepage structure (PDF export of the Google Doc; the live Google Doc could not be opened in this session — see Open items) | Section order for the homepage. |

Everything on the site is either taken from an official source below, or visibly marked **“To be confirmed”** (the dashed yellow `<Tbc>` marker) so it can’t be mistaken for fact. All sources were checked on 30 September 2026 (homepage re-checked 1 October 2026).

## How the content is kept accurate

- **No disease claims.** Copy says ellura *supports* urinary tract health and *may help reduce* bacterial adhesion. Pages state that it is not a treatment and cannot replace antibiotics, and tell readers to see a doctor about symptoms.
- **Study summaries** (Science page) describe what each study examined. They are labelled as being about cranberry PAC research, not claims about ellura.
- **Anti-adhesion chart** reproduces the official graphic’s qualitative axis (100%, <50%, Inferior, Inactive 0%), with no invented numbers. Source: Howell et al., *J Diet Suppl* 2022.
- **Reviews.** There are no Indian reviews yet and none are invented. The US store totals and three verbatim US reviews are always labelled “US store”.
- **Doctor quote** is shown with the disclosure “Compensated Medical Advisor for ellura®”, exactly as on the US site.

## Open items (shown on the site as “To be confirmed”)

**Process**
- The Google Doc with the homepage structure was not readable here (Google Drive connector not authorised). The v3 homepage follows the PDF export of that doc (`Ellura - Website Structure & References.pdf`). Please compare it with the live doc and tell us about any section added after the export.

**Commercial**
- India prices for the **90-capsule** pack and the **180-capsule bundle**. These products show “Price at launch” with a notify-me form. Set the prices in `src/commerce/catalog.ts`.
- The ₹2,199 / ₹2,499 price for 30 capsules comes from the design reference only. Confirm it, then set `PRICING_VERIFIED = true` so the Product JSON-LD includes `offers`.
- Shipping rates for one-time orders, delivery timelines, serviceable PIN codes.
- Return window (the US store allows 45 days), refund timeline, cancellation window, return-shipping responsibility.
- Launch offers and coupon codes. No India codes were supplied, so the promo field reports that codes apply once the store is live.
- My ellura Rewards for India: points rates, redemption values, referral credits.
- Amazon.in store link, plus quick-commerce partners and dates.

**Legal and regulatory**
- India seller/importer legal entity, address, GSTIN and Grievance Officer (Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020).
- India regulatory category, licence number and the matching disclaimer. The FDA disclaimer is kept because the product label is a US dietary supplement label.
- Policy pages are **drafts** that need legal review.

**Support**
- India customer-care phone, WhatsApp, hours and response time. The verified brand email `hello@ellurautihealth.com` is used meanwhile.
- Review moderation policy (Reviews page).

**Content**
- Medical reviewer name and credentials for each Learn article (the CSV requires a reviewer credit).

## v2 notes (still true in v3)

- **Reviews on the homepage and PDP** show only the US-store average (computed from the published 72/5/1/0/0 breakdown) and the three verbatim US reviews. No per-review star ratings are shown because the source page does not show them.
- **Pack tiles** tint the studio background of the official pack photos; the product itself is not recoloured. Badges (“Start here”, “3-month supply”, “2 bottles · 6 months”) are descriptive, not sales claims. No “bestseller” label is used because no sales data exists.
- **“Recommended by Urologists”** keeps the doc’s heading and Dr. Chughtai’s quote with the compensated-advisor disclosure.

## Missing assets

- **UGC videos** for the homepage loop (doc Section 2). Each reel in `src/components/home/Reels.tsx` accepts `video: '/videos/<file>.mp4'` (9:16, muted, looped). Until videos arrive, the reels use editorial stills with captions that describe routines; they are not testimonials.
- A vector (SVG) logo. The supplied raster logo is used (`public/brand/`), trimmed, with white and mark variants derived from it.
- India-specific lifestyle photography. The stock images below are placeholders.

## Photography

**Official (Pharmatoka, ellurautihealth.com CDN):** pack shots (30, 90, 180), carton side panels, the four infographics, the transparent bottle compositions, the Dr. Chughtai portrait (cropped to remove the baked-in caption), and the badges (20+ years, cGMP, 2026 Mindful Awards).
